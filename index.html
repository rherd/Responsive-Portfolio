      <p>Hello, my name is Rob Herd. I am 26 years old, native to Atlanta, GA. I am married to my beautiful and patient wife Alex Herd,
        and have two wonderfully noisy dogs named Goose and Duck. Goose is a Siberian Husky, and Duck is a Mountain Cur/climbing
        dog. I currently work as a support analyst/developer at PowerPlan, Inc., which develops financial software solutions
        for asset-intensive industries.</p>

      <p>I went to school at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I studied Aerospace Engineering for 5 years before finally breaking
          free and graduating. I have since gone on to other fields of work and study, including this class, where I hope to finally
          learn the development skills that I use at my job everyday. Some of my hobbies outside of work/school include playing
          the piano, fencing, playing tennis, and taking my dogs on roadtrips and adventures. I love cold brew coffee and tacos.</p>
